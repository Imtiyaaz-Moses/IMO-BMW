        <h2>Fierce & On Fire.<br>The BMW X5M Black Fire Edition.</h2>
        Experience the power, excitement and exclusivity of the colour black. The BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M embody pure elegance and agility, bringing power to the streets. The bold exterior is complemented with a high-class interior design and finishes. Expect supreme handling and dynamics in the Black Fire Edition, no matter the terrain.
        <h2><b><i>4.2 sec.</i></b></h2>
        The new Edition Black Fire of the BMW X5 M and the BMW X6 M do 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.2 seconds with the standard 8-speed M Steptronic gearbox.
        <h4>IMPOSING CHARACTER.</h4>
        The rich shade of black in the Sapphire Black Metallic paintjob and black M double kidney with black bars are enough to set your heart alight. The carbon mirror caps, which come as standard on both models, further accentuate their lightweight design and motorsport DNA.
        <h4>RACING INTERIOR.</h4>
        The interior of the BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M have a distinctly Motorsport feel with contrasting Black and Mugello Red Merino leather. The M multifunctional seats are fully-electric and come as standard, along with the multifunctional M leather steering wheel with aluminium shift paddles. The BMW M Performance Alcantara steering wheel with light-blue leather motorsport accent is also available as an option at no extra charge.
        Interior trim in Piano Black and the Black Fire Edition logo on the right passenger side are just a further reminder of the exclusivity of the BMW X5 M and X6 M Black Fire Edition.
        The BMW X5 M combines the spirit of an M tradition sports car with the outstanding functionality of an X model. Its high-torque M TwinPower Turbo 8-cylinder petrol engine, 8-speed M Steptronic and M-specific xDrive let you take driving pleasure to the extreme. The dynamic design of the front and rear aprons and standard-feature 20Êº light alloy wheels guarantee an impressive presence. The generous interior of this Sports Utility Vehicle contains premium materials, elevated seats with a sporty shape and a variety of details in the characteristic M design. The BMW X5 M combines the best of two worlds. It brings you outstanding performance and handling and, at the same time, excellent functionality and day-to-day suitability.
        <h4><b><i>423 kW.</i></b></h4>
        The BMW X5 M features two high-rev TwinScroll turbochargers which have been tested on racetracks and boast a cooling system with four circuits and ten radiators to keep thermal stress under control. A cross-bank exhaust manifold for perfect exhaust gas flow, also means optimum power development and lightning-quick responsiveness. This powerplant is simply awesome. With its massive torque of up to 750 Nm, the 4.4 litre, 423kW M TwinPower Turbo 8-cylinder petrol engine powers the BMW X5 M forward with minimum effort. It accelerates the vehicle from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.2 seconds. Despite this top performance, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions remain moderate. Thanks to a wide range of BMW EfficientDynamics technologies, the combined values are 11.1 l/100 km and 258 g/km respectively.
