        <h2>The New Generation Of A Vision.<br>The new BMW i8 Coupé.</h2>
        The future is taking shape in the form of the new BMW i8 Coupé. Full of verve, fascinating and ready to newly define mobility. For unconditional driving pleasure, as far as the road goes. A mere glimpse of this iconic design elevates adrenaline levels. The tachometer shoots up just as fast: the innovative plug-in hybrid engine generates 275 kW and 570 Nm. Plus, the new BMW i8 Coupé accelerates from 0 to 100 km in just 4.4 seconds.
        <h4>A GLANCE AT THE FUTURE.</h4>
        The BMW i8 Coupé reveals itself as futuristic right down to the last detail. Its progressive lines speak a formal language that can hardly be more dynamic. The most striking feature: the imposing lightweight carbon-fibre gull wing doors, which can be opened comfortably. The athletic front continues to display the individual character of the car and proudly bears the BMW double kidney, flanked by full-LED headlights and redesigned Air Curtains. Starting at the bonnet, the distinctive V-shaped black belt stretches along the entire car, underscoring its flat silhouette. The impressive streamflow design also optimises airflow and creates unprecedented aerodynamics. Thus, the BMW i8 Coupé is a perfect symbiosis of form and function that knows only one direction: forward.
        <h4>CONTROL CENTRE OF TOMORROW.</h4>
        The interior of the BMW i8 Coupé also underscores its unique character. This is immediately apparent from the exclusive feature line Accaro Amido/E-Copper. The interior also reflects the dynamic lines of the exterior design, creating a futuristic dynamic throughout the cockpit. The centre cockpit is inclined to the driver and the controls are arranged intuitively – ensuring maximum driver orientation and clarity. Optimum lateral support and maximum comfort are provided by the new electrically-adjustable sport seats. In the dark, the LED interior lighting ensures a high-quality ambience. The contour lines of the doors, the instrument panel and the centre console and the steering wheel can be optionally and alternately dipped in the colours EfficientDynamics Blue, Amber Yellow and White.
        <h4>DYNAMICS NEWLY DEFINED.</h4>
        The BMW i8 Coupé takes even the headwind’s breath away. This is not only due to its athletic appearance, but also its streamlined body, the extreme lightweight construction and the layered design of the LED tail lights, which the wind flows through.
        <h4>A NEW FORM OF LIGHTWEIGHT.</h4>
        Take the lead. It’s easy with the new BMW i8 Coupé. One of the reasons is its exceptional lightweight concept: the LifeDrive Architecture. It consists of the Drive module – an aluminium chassis and the Life module – an ultralight passenger compartment made of high-strength carbon-fibre. Both components are weight-optimised down to the last gram in order to take thought-out sustainability with perfected sportiness efficiently to the road.
        <h4>THE FREEDOM TO REACH EVERYTHING.</h4>
        At home, you can easily charge your BMW i8 with the BMW i Wallbox or the charging cable. A personalised consultation, the professional assembly and the initial setup are all ensured by a qualified electrician. On the road, you’ll find an ever-growing number of public charging stations that you can easily use with the ChargeNow card. Find out where the next charging station is with the ChargeNow app or, alternatively, directly in your BMW i8 Coupé: for example, via the fully-networked BMW ConnectedDrive services for navigation.
