        <h2>The Icon. Further Enhanced.<br>The all-new BMW M3 CS</h2>
        The all-new BMW M3 CS is the latest special model from BMW M GmbH and at the same time the most powerful standard production vehicle of all time in the M3 model series. The high-performance sedan continues the successful tradition of high-performance cars that began with the legendary BMW M3 Evolution. Equipped with numerous carbon lightweight components and innovative M technologies, the extreme athlete achieves an impressive best time of 7 minutes, 38 seconds on the legendary Nordschleife of the Nürburgring. At the same time, the BMW M3 CS, which is limited to a production run of some 1,200 units, impresses with the everyday utility of a four-door sports sedan. The culmination of a sporting icon.
        <h4>Athletic front.</h4>
        Even the very first impression could barely be any sportier: the flat double kidney grill with black painted slats and the unmistakable, optional Adaptive LED double headlights lend the front of the BMW M3 CS an uncompromisingly dynamic presence. The three-part front apron with large air inlets ensures efficient cooling of the 6-cylinder high-performance engine as well as the M compound brakes or optional M Carbon ceramic brakes – and enhances the overall athletic image. Further reducing the lift on the front axle and additionally increasing the driving dynamics is the distinctive CS model-specific front splitter made of lightweight clear-coated carbon, which is permitted on public roads.
        <h4>Superior power.</h4>
        Under the bonnet of the BMW M3 CS is an M TwinPower Turbo inline 6-cylinder petrol engine to ensure breath-taking driving performances of a superlative class. The dynamic high-performance power unit uses its 338 kW and torque of 600 Nm to accelerate the extreme athlete from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds, bringing it to a top speed limited at 280 km/h.
        <h4>Efficient lightweight construction.</h4>
        The BMW M3 CS inspires through the use of numerous weight-reduced lightweight components. Produced from CFRP, the bonnet is 25 per cent lighter than the already weight-optimised aluminium bonnet in the BMW M3 Sedan. The slightly recessed roof in the middle section also consists of CFRP. This saves a further six kilograms compared with a metal roof while additionally lowering the centre of gravity and thus guaranteeing even more agility and dynamics. The lightweight concept continues systematically through the interior, which features the ergonomic lightweight-construction M sport seats and a centre console weighing 30 per cent less than its counterpart in the standard production model.
        Optimum contact with the road.
        Ideal driving characteristics up to the limits come from the spectacular, newly developed ten-spoke light alloy wheels in Orbit Grey. The forged, weight-optimised wheels allude to the ten-spoke design of the BMW M4 DTM race touring car. They are equipped as standard with tyres of the type Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 of size 265/35 R 19 at the front and 285/30 R 20 at the rear. For even greater everyday utility, Michelin sport tyres with a stronger tread pattern are also available as an option.
        <h4>Impressive rear.</h4>
        The characteristic rear of the BMW M3 CS perfectly matches its thoroughly powerful design language. One special feature is the Gurney flap made of clear-coated carbon, which reduces the lift on the rear axles, thus ensuring optimised driving characteristics – particularly at higher speeds. Made entirely of CFRP, the M diffuser is a dynamic eye-catcher and forms a striking finish to the rear. The distinctive stainless steel M twin tailpipes of the double-flow M sport exhaust system bear the M logo.
        <h4><b><i>338 KW</i></b></h4>
        Impressive power calls for a high level of precision. This is why the all-new BMW M3 CS inspires with numerous high-performance components that combine extremely precise driving characteristics with the greatest possible dynamics. M Drive, the electromechanical steering M Servotronic and an M double-clutch transmission with an especially sporty design therefore ensure outstanding performance – regardless of whether you are on the road or race track. In addition to this, the damper control can be ideally adjusted via the specially tuned Adaptive M suspension and its three different driving modes. According to requirements and route characteristics – for a maximum of agility, steering precision and everyday utility.
