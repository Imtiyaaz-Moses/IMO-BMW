        <h2>Sharper Than Ever.<br>The M5 Competition Sport.</h2>
        Excitingly and elegantly shaped. More powerful than ever. The new generation of the BMW M5 is a statement of supreme engineering skill and innovative driving intelligence. For hitherto unimagined dimensions of driving dynamics up to the limits. Full of state-of-the-art technologies that make the everyday business routine safer and more comfortable. The innovative all-wheel drive system M xDrive of the powerful all-new BMW M5 with its 441 kW engine turns the driver into the self-assured pilot of a high-performance sports sedan with unbelievable power, precision and agility – pure M driving pleasure on a new level.
        <h4>M design.</h4>
        With just a few lines, the clear, M specific design of the BMW M5 signals consistent dynamism – from every angle. BMW Individual high-gloss Shadow Line exclusively emphasises the athletic character.
        <h4>M exterior mirror.</h4>
        The M specific exterior mirrors in double-bridged design and with additional integrated LED indicators are a significant part of the sporty and dynamic M design and convey a sense of precision engineering down to the last detail.
        <h4>M kidney grille.</h4>
        The striking M kidney grille with M5 logo and high-gloss Black double slats makes it unmistakably clear that the powerful engine behind the sporty front end can deliver a breathtaking performance.
        <h4>M front bonnet.</h4>
        Two characteristic creases shape the bonnet of the all-new BMW M5 designed in lightweight aluminium. The design of the CFRP roof picks up the M specific lines and continues them systematically to the rear.
        <h4>M Carbon roof.</h4>
        As part of the intelligent lightweight design concept, the M Carbon roof made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) and the aluminium bonnet help reduce the vehicle weight, improving driving dynamics.
        <h4>M gills.</h4>
        The characteristic M side air vent element in high-gloss Black with the M5 model designation, which adds a pronounced three-dimensional athletic touch, underscores the dynamic combination of technical perfection and breathtaking design that has been synonymous with M vehicles since day one.
        <h4>20" light alloy wheel 789 M.</h4>
        The exclusively forged 20'' M light alloy wheels 789 M in bicolor look with mixed tyres featuring a dynamic Y-spoke design underline the athleticism of the BMW M5 Competition.
        <h4>M twin tailpipes.</h4>
        The typical M twin tailpipes, the central diffuser and the rear apron in high-gloss Black are an unmistakeable display of the sporting aspirations of the BMW M5 Competition.
