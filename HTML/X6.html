        <h4><b><i>423 kW.</i></b></h4>
        The BMW X6 M boasts two high-rev TwinScroll turbochargers. It's been tested on racetracks and with a cooling system with four circuits and ten radiators to keep thermal stress under control, and a cross-bank exhaust manifold for perfect exhaust gas flow, it's displayed optimum power development and lightning-quick responsiveness. This powerplant is simply awesome. With its massive torque of up to 750 Nm, the 4.4 litre, 423 kW M TwinPower Turbo 8-cylinder petrol engine powers the BMW X6 M forward with minimum effort. It accelerates the vehicle from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.2 seconds. Despite this top performance, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions remain moderate.
